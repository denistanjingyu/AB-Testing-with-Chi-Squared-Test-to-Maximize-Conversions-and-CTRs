## Overview
A/B testing in its simplest sense is an experiment on two variants to see which performs better based on a given metric. Typically, two consumer groups are exposed to two different versions of the same thing to see if there is a significant difference in metrics like sessions, click-through rate, and/or conversions.

## Code and Resources Used
**Python:** Version 3.7.4
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy
