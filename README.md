## Overview
A/B testing in its simplest sense is an experiment on two variants to see which performs better based on a given metric. Typically, two consumer groups are exposed to two different versions of the same thing to see if there is a significant difference in metrics like sessions, click-through rate, and/or conversions.

## Introduction
In this project, we will be using the chi-squared test to validate an A/B test performed by a company to test the effectiveness of a new webpage in increasing conversion rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used to perform the A/B test was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zhangluyuan/ab-testing).

## Code and Resources Used
**Python:** Version 3.7.4

**Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy
